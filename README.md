# In Good Nick

This datapack aims to make Minecraft more challenging, with a caveat that the challenge is throughout late-game progression.

## Features

This datapack implements 3 fundamental rebalancing features, and tries to do it with a high degree of polish:

1. Players start with a maximum 3 hearts (6hp).
2. Players can use collectables ("Constitution Ruby" & "Spiteful Amber") to increase their maximum health to 20 hearts (40hp).
3. These collectables are seperated to encourage progression, with the "Constitution Ruby" not usable after you maximum health is back up to 10 hearts, and the "Spiteful Amber" an optional progression for the next 10 hearts.

## Compatibility

Here's a list of datapacks we are well integrated with:

## Roadmap

In the future, I want "In Good Nick" to develop towards this direction:

- More super late-game progression, after the player has maximised their hearts.

- Some accessible in-game documentation/wiki.

- Compatibility with Dungeons and Taverns.

- Compatibility with Terralith.

- Compatibility with the popular datapacks, specifically those which introduce dungeons/trials.
